Step-by-Step Guide to Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers for FastAPI
1. File Structure Example

If your project is structured like this:

my-project/
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py           # FastAPI app
│   ├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── README.md
Your FastAPI application (app = FastAPI()) is inside backend/main.py.
2. Gunicorn + Uvicorn Command

You would need to run Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers. Here’s the command to launch the FastAPI app properly.

Command to run your FastAPI app:

gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker backend.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
Explanation:

-w 4: Runs 4 worker processes for better concurrency. You can adjust this number based on your server resources.
-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker: Uses Uvicorn as the worker class, which is designed for running ASGI applications like FastAPI.
backend.main:app: This refers to the FastAPI app instance. It's assuming that:
The backend/ folder contains the main.py file.
Inside main.py, your FastAPI app is defined with the variable name app (i.e., app = FastAPI()).
--bind 0.0.0.0:8000: Binds the server to 0.0.0.0 (so it's accessible from anywhere) on port 8000.
3. Running in Production with Gunicorn

You can run this command on your production server (e.g., when deploying to Render or AWS). This will start the FastAPI app with 4 Gunicorn worker processes, each using Uvicorn as the worker for ASGI.

Additional Notes on Deployment
File Paths: When specifying backend.main:app, ensure that the path matches the file structure.
Configuration for Render: If you're deploying this on Render or any other platform, you typically add this start command in your Render web service settings (in the "Start Command" field).
For example:

Start Command: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker backend.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

Why Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers?
Uvicorn is an ASGI server and is best for FastAPI apps, allowing them to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
Gunicorn can manage multiple processes, which is crucial for handling multiple requests concurrently in a production environment.
By using Uvicorn workers with Gunicorn, you get the benefits of both:
Uvicorn handles asynchronous capabilities of FastAPI.
Gunicorn manages multiple worker processes for concurrency and fault tolerance.

Summary
To run your FastAPI app located in backend/main.py with Gunicorn and Uvicorn workers, use this command:

gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker backend.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
